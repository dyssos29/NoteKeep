# NoteKeep
This is an Android application which enables the user to take notes and upload them on cloud. More precisely, it is a client application which consumes the services of a RESTful API, exchanging JSON messages. As such, the resource in this case is the "note" and the operations available are the "Create", "Read" and "Delete" (CRD).
